NodeHost.Online is a software platform that makes masternode management easy, smooth, and overall a notably better experience. NodeHost provides a simple and secure web portal for any user to deploy, manage and analyze their cryptocurrency masternodes. (Nodehost was recently achired by another company so it's not working anylonger)
