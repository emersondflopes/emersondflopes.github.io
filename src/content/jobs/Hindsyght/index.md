feedback: "Emerson delivered good work on our web development project and I enjoyed working with him. His communication was top-notch. He met all deadlines, and his skills were strong. He was very forthcoming that the additional work was outside of his area of expertise. I enjoyed working with Emerson and will likely have additional jobs for him in the future."
