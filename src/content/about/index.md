Hello! I'm Emerson Lopes, a software developer based in Montes Claros, Brazil who quite enjoys building things that live on the internet.

I really like to learn new things. I know how to play the guitar ðŸŽ¸ & I speak four languages: Portuguese ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· English ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ and Spanish ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸. I love reading books and exploring. Also, Rick and Morty is my favorite TV show.

I am an independent top rated freelancer on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01a17ee21ec1f97f8c), specialized in designing and implementing high-quality web applications. I aim to provide a flawless freelance experience, combining excellent understanding, great communication, and speedy delivery.

I'm currently studying Information Systems at the [State University of Montes Claros](https://www.unimontes.br/).
